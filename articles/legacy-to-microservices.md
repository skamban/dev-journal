# From Debugging Legacy Systems to Building Scalable Microservices: 3 Lessons I Learned

👩‍💻 I started my career maintaining legacy .NET systems — understanding dense code, improving stability, and fixing bugs buried 5 layers deep.

Fast forward to today, I’ve led the development of scalable, secure microservices using ASP.NET Core, Azure, and modern DevOps pipelines.

Here are 3 lessons that stuck with me through that journey:

---

### 1 Write Code for the Next Developer

Legacy systems taught me this the hard way.  
- Clear naming
- Fewer side effects
- Meaningful comments

These are not “nice-to-have” — they’re essential. Maintainable code saves time, prevents bugs, and makes onboarding easier for new devs.

---

### 2️⃣ Think in Services, Not Screens

Moving to microservices changed how I see architecture.  
- Each service should do **one thing well**
- Be independently deployable
- Fail gracefully

Designing services this way brings clarity, scalability, and faster development cycles.

---

### 3️⃣ Security is Not a Last Step

Whether it’s preventing unauthorized access in assessments or blocking screen capture tools —  
**security must be designed from Day 1**.

Waiting until the end introduces risk, rewrites, and lost time. Secure coding is just smart coding.

---

### Final Thoughts

Whether you're working on a monolith or breaking it into services — these lessons always apply.

🗣️ What’s one lesson *you* learned from legacy code?
